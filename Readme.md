# HashPerf

Really **confusing** benchmark.

Maybe you're thinking about hashmaps as silver bullets.
Well, they **ARE** fast, but with some costs.

`dotnet run -c Release`

At end of the day, final decision: should I use *primary key* - or *chain of responsibity pattern*?
Look for mathod: `HashLookup_PrimaryKey`
I is up to you, as always.

There is no ✅ or ❌.
